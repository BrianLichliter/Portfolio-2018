# Measure, Manage, and Minimize your Carbon Footprint with EcoCRED
For a majority of my 2 years at Drawn I've been working on a sustainability focused application with Exelon called EcoCRED. In just 2 years, we've been able to take it all the way from an idea in a brainstorm to a built application in the App Store. 

## Mobilizing Employees to Create Greener Companies

EcoCRED is an application we built with Exelon that aims to help companies educate and mobilize their employees around corporate sustainability goals and being greener in general. Over the course of the project we progressed through the main levels of maturity a product goes through: idea, concept, prototype, and product.

#### IDEA

The project began as a brainstorm between the two teams but quickly it became clear the energy and potential behind the idea. Jumping into a week long design sprint, we were able to outline what would become our guideposts in terms of goals, success metrics, and desired audience and begin our research into the area.

#### CONCEPT

During our early research we focused on learning more about the goals and activities of those interested in sustainability. We conducted feedback sessions and created quick concepts to garner both what people already think and do in their daily lives with respect to sustainablity and what they thought about some of our possible ideas as a whole.

#### PROTOTYPE

After a few months of iteration and progression through various concepts and a fresh coat of paint we arrived at a prototype we all felt good about. This was an important milestone for us as it allowed us to have an anchoring point during discussions with key stakeholders and future feedback sessions for the product.

#### PRODUCT

After many many discussions we were able to get the green light on development and were off to the races. During development I acted as a the lead designer and scrum master making sure development matched up with the design and working with our developers when necessary to solve problems and get our idea out there.
