##### Tellascope
# Designing a social Pocket before they did
During the winter and spring of senior year, I worked on Tellascope, a news and media solution for helping millennials find quality content on the web. I worked with a diverse group of people including those from journalism, marketing, business, and computer science and was a part of the products realization from idea to production.

## Helping people find what to read, when they have time to read it.
As a designer and a computer engineer, I was heavily involved with user research and development of the application. I created paper prototypes, wireframes, and worked tirelessly on the front-end code to make sure the experience the user had when visiting Tellascope was an intuitive and relaxing one. In addition to usability testing, I conducted user interviews every week to listen, understand, and learn about our target users and the industry we were heading into. I talked with journalists at prominent organizations such as the Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch as well as users across our target demographic, always making sure to synthesize and understand what I had heard after interviews.

All of this culminated in our final pitch to the advisory board of the NUvention Web organization which included industry professionals from a variety of fields such as journalism, tech, and business. While our team is no longer actively developing Tellascope, its spirit lives on through the code base and resources we left in our repository so that others working on something similar in the future can learn from our mistakes and successes.
