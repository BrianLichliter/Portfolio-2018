# Unifying Business and Consumer Needs for Parts Source

Parts Source as a company tends to be referred to as the Amazon of hospital parts. When you need anything related tot he medical industry you go to Parts Source. As is common with heavily Enterprise focused endeavours, the company was heasitant to change anything about their website for years in order to not disturb the workflows of the thousands of businesses relying on their site. Fast forward a bit and Parts Source began nurturing a renewed focus towards the consumer market fueled by moves across the industry and with a desire to put the usability of their website at the top of the priority list.

## Complex Business Logic, Simple and Easy Experience

The problem Parts Source had identified was that a simple and easy experience was not possible with the amount of business logic they had acrued over the years working with Enterprise customers. It was with that challenge in mind that we began our week long sprint with a specializing team fom Parts Source.

Their were a number of goals for the sprint: understand and document the business logic that existed along the common purchasing path for key individuals within a hospital, evaluate and scan experiences, patterns, and interactions being utilizied by compeititors, create proof of concept prototypes that demonstrated that a simpler experience did not necessarily mean abadoning the business logic.

During the sprint I faciliated design exercises, crafted artifacts detailing the market, and created and presented prototypes demonstrating what the future of Parts Source could look like.
