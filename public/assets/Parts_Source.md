# Unifying Business and Consumer Needs for Parts Source

Parts Source, a company known as the "Amazon for hospital parts" is where you go when you need anything related to the medical industry. As is common with heavily enterprise focused endeavours, the company tended to hesistate about any possible change to their website in order to not disturb the workflows of the thousands of businesses relying on their site. Fast forward a bit and Parts Source has begun nurturing a renewed focus towards the consumer market fueled by moves across the industry and with a desire to put the usability of their website at the top of the priority list.

## Creating a simple and easy experience without comprising business needs.

The problem Parts Source had identified was that a simple and easy experience was very difficult to execute due to the amount of business logic they had acrued over the years working with their enterprise customers. It was with that challenge in mind that we began our week long sprint with a specialized team from Parts Source.

There were a number of goals I was tasked with during the sprint including: understand and document the business logic that existed along the common purchasing path for key individuals within a hospital, evaluate and scan experiences, patterns, and interactions being utilizied by compeititors, and create proof of concept prototypes that demonstrated that a simpler experience did not necessarily mean abadoning the complex business logic.

During the sprint I faciliated design exercises, crafted artifacts detailing the market, and created and presented prototypes demonstrating what the future of Parts Source could look like.
