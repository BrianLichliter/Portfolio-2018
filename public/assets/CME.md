# Refining the Toolkit for Making Fast Software Faster

CME, a leading trading market in the futures space, is in a unique space. The software they create and use to complete trades is so fast that figuring out how to make it faster by a 1ms is not only difficult but extremely valuable to the company. It was this business challenge that lead to the development of an internal tool called Telemetry which enabled CME to gain insights & make performance improvements in a way not possible with external tools.

## Some of the most valuable milliseconds in the industry

Extremely happy with how the tool had helped them internally, CME knew this could be something valuable to those in other industries that rely on high performance software. It was at this point that we began a workshop with them to help consolidate and focus their message, create & polish their materials, and equip them with what they needed to talk to potential customers.

During the workshop, our team worked tirelessly to not only understand the complex tool the team had built but also to codify their vision for the future in a way that allowed them to socialize both internally and externally. From there, we created storyboards of an animated explainer for their production team to create and designed the landing page for the tool.

I faciliated exercises with the client using my previous experiences as a computer engineer and developer, created the design for the landing page and subsequently built it in Webflow, and supported all other aspects of the workshop. Following the workshop, the client team immediately sprung into action talking with perspective clients using our materials and a more focused understanding of what their tool could provide. The live website created in Webflow can be found [here](https://www.doyoutelemetry.com/).
