# Engineering Design Innovation With Procter & Gamble

When enrolling in the M.S. Engineering Design and Innovation (EDI) program at Northwestern University, one of the many benefits  we received was the opportunity to work with some of the most well known and respected companies around. Procter & Gamble is one such company, renowned for their innovation in the space of consumer goods and constantly displaying a standard of excellence with the products they produce. I had the pleasure of working with teams within P&G twice during my time with EDI. I was able to produce value equal to that of a design firm across the disciplines of product design and service design. All work was done under non-disclosure agreement and both projects were awarded with an intellectual property retention award.

## Re-imagining the services P&G can offer to its consumers.

During the spring of 2015, our studio partnered up with various stakeholders within P&G to imagine what some of their products would be if they were offered as services. To begin, we dove in to the market to understand what was available to consumers already. A strong foundation in market research and competitor analysis allowed us to understand the intricacies of the business and what solutions were already out there and successful.

Once we understood the market, we then researched our target consumers and stakeholders to begin gathering requirements and understand key insights and themes in the research. Using this research, we brainstormed a variety of solutions ranging the gamut of small to big to simple to crazy. Following the brainstorm we progressed forward using the mantra build, measure, learn¬ù to understand the benefits and painpoints with our ideas and to continue iterating throughout the process.

All of this culminated in a final presentation in front of a variety of senior stakeholders in P&G. Following presentations from the entire studio our work was compared to that of top design firms P&G has worked with and next steps were formulated with the internal teams for each project.
